//
// Imports: only `world_info.dart` — the Starry source pulled in Flutter
// foundation, Riverpod, session_prompt_context, character_assembly_models,
// persona, starry_providers, preset_repository, resource_binding_repository,
// worldbook_repository, character_entities exclusively for the Resolver

// WorldInfoMatchContext / WorldInfoPosition / WorldInfoScanSource.
//
// Class / method / field / parameter names byte-identical to the Starry
// source, including the `const` ctor, so downstream call sites and
// characterization goldens stay valid under SUT=package.
